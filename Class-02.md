# HTML/CSS

HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page, and to
provide semantic information.
CSS treats each element as if it was inside a box. rules are made up of selectors, and declarations.
wich indicate what these elements should look like.

  Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements. declarations are made up of two parts, the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of said properties. CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, but can be used inside an HTML document as well.

## JavaScript, and functions and loops
  
  A script is made up of a series of statements. Each one is like a step in a recipe. They contain very precise instructions to follow. Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of info used in the script. JS distinguishes between numbers, strings and boolean values, while expressions evaluate into a single value. 

  ## Decisions and Loops my favorite!

    Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions without your help. Compariso n operators are used to compare two operands. Logical operators all you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
