GROWTH MINDSET
Growth mindset, what is it to me...

Well I think Growth mindset is in simple terms. An approach to self growth that uses constant improvement of your Basic abilities to CONTINUE to improve those abilities. There is no "cap" it's a continual cycle, nothing is preordained. As long as you keep pushing yourself you will continue to grow. Nothing is predetermined they sky is the limit.
