# reading notes for HTML introduction

 HTML
Lets talk a bit about html ! HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. It has a series of elements that you use to enclose different parts of your content to make it look a certain way.

TAGS
  * opening tag: the name of the element wrapped in opening and closing brackets.
  * closing tag: same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forwrd slash before the element name. this shows where the element ends.
  * CONTENT: This is the content of the tag, the meat if you will .
  * ELEMENT: All of these tags together comprise an element.
  elements can also contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content.
  wich would appear like class="whatever you want in here"
ATTRIBUTE RULES
  1. A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
  2. The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
  3. The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.  
  
  HTML uses elements to describe the STRUCTURE of a webpage.

  Tags act like containers !

  A webpage has many different elements wich are enclosed by tags.  < >

  The main ones are header, head, body, main and footer.

  attributes of an element require a name and a value.
