## What is CSS
  CSS helps you to create great-looking web pages by defining rules that your webpage will use.

  ## CSS example
    " h1 { color: red; font-size 5em;}"
    In this example your h1 text would be red with a text size of 5em.

    In the previous example h1 would be considered the selector. Whats inside the curly braces would be the declarations, wich can be multiple things wich form property and value pairs.

      Css is broken down into modules, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) is a good place to go to reference these.
