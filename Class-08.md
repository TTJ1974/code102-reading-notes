# Tables, List's, and Forms

    A table in HTML consists of table cells inside rows and columns. while a form is used to collect user input.
    An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.
    The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default:

    A form may have several form controls, each gathering different information. The server needs to know which piece of inputted data correstponds with which form element.

        list markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties.
        Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.
        Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.
        Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.
