# WIREFRAME
  What is a wireframe, and what is it used for ?  Wireframe is a basic design used to plan out your webpage or other project in a simple time effective manner.

## Wireframe Examples
  * Hand drawn, quick and easy to build on or change.
  * Software based: paint, miro, or other software based programs.

# HTML

  Lets talk a bit about html !
    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.
    It has a series of elements that you use to enclose different parts of your content to make it look a certain way.

  ## TAGS
      * opening tag: the name of the element wrapped in opening and closing brackets.
      * closing tag: same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forwrd slash before the element name. this shows where the element ends.
      * CONTENT: This is the content of the tag, the meat if you will .
      * ELEMENT: All of these tags together comprise an element.
      elements can also contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content.
      wich would appear like class="whatever you want in here"

  ## ATTRIBUTE RULES
      1. A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
      2. The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
      3. The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.  

  ## Nesting elements
      You can put elements inside other elements too â€” this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a <strong> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:

  ## SEMANTICS
    Semantics refers to the *meaning* of a piece of code, for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)
 ## Semantics in HTML
    in HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
