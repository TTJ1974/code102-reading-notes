  ## GROWTH MINDSET
   A growth mindset is simply a belief that you can develop your abilities.  People with a growth mindset believe that the mind is like a muscle that can be strengthened with use.
   
   ### REMINDERS
   * **Consistently** challenge yourself, when done correctly it will change the way you perceive said challenges.  Making it a enjoyable excercise rather than a frustrating one.
   * **PUSH** yourself through the procrastinating thoughts and learn that when something that needs doing is finally completed, there will be a feeling of satisfaction as a reward.
   * **LOOK BACK** on your day and focus on the positive things while letting the negative things fall to the wayside.
