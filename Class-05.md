# HTML Links, JS Functions, and intro to CSS

## HTML links

Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer. They've been a feature of the Web since the beginning, and are what makes the Web a web. Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address. 

The anchor element is used to create hyperlinks between a source anchor and a destination anchor. The source is the text, image, or button that links to another resource and the destination is the resource that the source anchor links to.

## JS Functions, CSS layout

JavaScript functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task, taking some form of input and returning an output. Once a JS function is defined (declared), you can use it by referencing its name with parentheses ( ) right after. Note that a function doesnâ€™t have to have parameters - they can simply be left blank in the parentheses: There can be zero, one, or multiple arguments in a function. If your function takes more than one argument, simply separate them with a comma inside of the parentheses. You can refer to the "addTwoNumbers" function at the top of this page for an example.
 Functions are great for efficiency
